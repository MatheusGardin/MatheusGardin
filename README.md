Hello, my name is Matheus Gardin, I'm 17 years old. I am a full stack developer with great appreciation for backend programming, I am a beginner programmer and I am in a very short time in this area but I found a passion in it. I love to program and I feel more and more stimulated to acquire knowledge and experience in this area that is so dear to me. Despite my little experience I am willing to help in the best possible way.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Technologies learned: PHP, Laravel, Bootstrap, Javascrip (Basic), Node.js (under development).
- I'm developing a project in PHP.
- Iâ€™m currently learning Node.js.
- I'm looking to collaborate on projects with any of these technologies: PHP, Laravel or Node.
- Ask me about PHP and Laravel.
